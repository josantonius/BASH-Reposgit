## Issues

Issues are very valuable for any project.

Great bug reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background.
- Steps to reproduce.
- Be specific.
- Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen.
- What actually happens.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work).

People love thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding. Thank you for creating them!
